            " At Fault by Kate Chopin: The Mistress of Place-du-Bois. The Creole widow of thirty. She lived alone with her grief; shutting out the.comeals that came to her from the demoralized \"hands\" of her husband Jérôme Lafirme. She felt at once the weight and sacredness of a trust brought consolation and awakened unsuspected powers of.doing.\n",
            " Jérôme Lafirme's death drove Thérèse to seek another domicile. The old homestead that nestled to the hill side and close to the river's edge, had been abandoned. The railroad brought soon after his death was viewed by many as of questionable benefit.\n",
            " David Hosmer had come to Mrs. Lafirme on the land with a moneyed offer for the privilege of cutting timber from her land for a given number of years. The company which he represented had in view the erection of a sawmill two miles back in the woods, close beside the bayou and at a convenient distance from the lake. The mill's unceasing buzz made pleasant music to his ears.\n",
            " He asked Thérèse: \"I was often in danger of losing sight of such necessity for myself\" \"Oh, there could be no fear of that,\" said Hosmer with a short laugh. Hosmer had great faith in his sister Melicent's ability to look after herself. \"She enjoys her visit more than I thought she would,\" he said.\n",
            " Thérèse visited the mill at the end of the summer with her brother in Louisiana. She watched with fascinated delight the great loglogs hauled dripping from the water, following each till it had transformed to the clean symmetry of sawed planks. The unending work made her giddy, and she could well understand the open revolt of the surly Joçint.\n",
            " The young man whom she so closely scrutinized was slightly undersized, but of close and brawny build. His features were handsome, of sharp and refined cut; and his eyes were black and brilliant. Melicent could not reconcile his voice to her liking; it was too softly low and feminine, and carried a note of pleading or pathos.\n",
            " Grégoire and Melicent crossed a lake on the shores of the bayou. Melicent was an Indian woman fleeing and seeking some wild and solitary retreat on the borders of this lake. \"It is an awful place,\" replied Melicent with a little appreciative shudder; adding \"do you consider me a bodily protection?\" \"Oh, they ain't no betta woman in the worlérèse, then then, \"you do like she wants.\"\n",
            " When Melicent came to visit her brother, Mrs. Lafirme persuaded him to move to Place-du-Bois. She foresaw no obstacle in the way of procuring the needed domestic aid in a place which was swarming with idle women and children. \"Got a cook yet, Mel?\" was Hosmer's daily enquiry on returning home, but was not without abundant hope of getting one.\n",
            " Hosmer and Melicent were induced to accept Mrs. Lafirme's generous generosity. One of that lady's many supernumeraries was detailed each morning to \"do up\" Miss Melicent's rooms. The picture of Joçint as she had last seen him, stayed with her, till a troubled desire moved her to see him again.\n",
            " Morico was making a tour of the woods when he came to see his son Joçint. Morico sat in a hide covered chair that had been worn smooth by years of usefulness. The old man's face clouded with pleasure and his hand trembled so that he was at some pains to place the feather which he was making.\n",
            " Hosmer felt at ease in Thérèse's company, in which he found himself at ease. The excitement of his encounter with Joçint had not yet died away; this softly delicious atmosphere; the subtlely delicious atmosphere of the pines; his unlooked for meeting with Théése-- all collectively stirred him with unusual emotions. \"What a splendid creature Beauregard is,\" he said, smoothing the animal's glossy mane with whip.\n",
            " Hosmer had come in from his ride, and seating himself in the large wicker chair that stood in the center of the room, became at once absorbed in reflections. Hosmer looked up at his sister, who sat sidewards on the edge of a table slightly removed, swaying a slippered foot to and fro in evident impatience. \"To be sure I do,\" said Hosmer, relying on a knowledge lent him by previous similar experiences, and taking in the clinging artistic drapery that enfolded her tall spare figure, \"you've a new gown on\"\n",
            " He was not versed in the reading of a woman's nature, and he found himself at a loss to interpret Thérèse's actions. He recalled how she had looked away from him when he had spoken the few tender words that were yet whirling in his memory. His reflections led to no certainty, except that he loved her and meant to tell her so.\n",
            " Melicent and Thérèse sat silently together in the veranda of the cottage to talk to her husband. \"I can't let the day go by without telling you many things that you ought to have known long ago,\" she said of her brother David. \"He appears very fond of you,\" she added, \"but there can be no question about the weight of David's.\"\n",
            " Thérèse had not reached the age of thirty-five without learning that life presents many insurmountable obstacles which must be accepted. Hosmer had decided that his interview with Mrs. Lafirme should not be left further to the caprice of accident. The following morning, the only sign of her mental disturbance, was an appearance that might have succeeded a night of unrefreshing sleep.\n",
            " Hosmer had feared it; he made no protest in words; his revolt was only in an added pallor and increased face lines. He arose and went to a near window, peering out between the partly open slats. \"I hadn't thought of your being a Catholic,\" he said, finally turning his arms around her with folded arms. \"There are some prejudices which a woman can't afford to part with, even at the price of happiness,\" she said. Hosmer: \"I am a poor hand to analyze character: my own or another's\"\n",
            " Hosmer's wife Fanny tried to draw him into society, but he resisted it. He said: \"I resisted anything so distasteful as being dragged through rounds of amusement that had no sort of attraction whatever for me\" Hosmer: \"A year after our marriage our boy was born. When he was three years old, he died.\"\n",
            " Hosmer had so long seen himself as a martyr that he could not of a sudden look at a different one. He felt her to be a woman with moral perceptions keener than his own. Hosmer's love, which in the past twenty-four hours had grown to.overwhelm him, moved him to a blind submission. He arose quickly--unhesitatingly--and took her in his arms.\n",
            " It was \"broad day,\" one of the requirements which Grégoire had named as essential for taking Melicent to visit old McFarlane's grave. But the sun was not \"shining mighty bright,\" the second condition they were willing to overlook, seeing that the month was September. They retreated into the woods, soon losing sight of everything but the underbrush that was scant and underbrush.\n",
            " Melicent first met Grégoire, his peculiarities of speech, sofamiliar to her, seemed to remove him at once from the possibility of her consideration. She bore with him, and then she liked him, but the admission embraced the understanding with herself, that nothing could come of it.\n",
            " The St. Louis Exposition was in progress with all its many allurements that had been heralded for months through the journals of the State. After a day of close and intense September heat, it had rained during the night. The change was one to send invigorating thrills through the blood, and to quicken the step. But with no reacting warmth in his heart, the change made him shiver and draw his coat closer about his chest.\n",
            " Hosmer arrived at the home of Thérèse Love and Fanny Larimore. The house at which Hosmer rang was very old-fashioned in face of its modern neighbors, and the recently metamorphosed dwelling next door was no longer recognizable for what it had been. Hosmer was relieved to find the little parlor into which he was in much changed.\n",
            " Fanny Larimore's strength of determination was not one to hold against her husband's will. Hosmer's will set to a purpose, during the time he proposed, she finally acquiesced. And she felt that his nearness was something that would belong to her again. Her life was sometimes blank in the blank intervals of intervals with him.\n",
            " Belle Worthington, known to her friends as Belle, was busy in constructing a careful and extremely elaborate street-toilet before her dressing bureau. The lower portion of this lady's figure was draped, or better, by an abundance of stiffly starched white petticoats that rustled audibly at her slightest movement. She was tall and thin, with hair, eyes, and a complex complexion of a brownish neutral tint, and bore in face and figure, a certain.stamp of defiance.\n",
            " Lou Dawson and Fanny Worthington lived in the same flat as Fanny Larimore. The two women were lovers of elegant leisure, and the amiability of their husbands enabled them to develop into finished and professional time-killers. Mrs. Worthingon's husband was a gentleman employed for many years past in the custom house. He was fond of sitting at the window, with his long thin nose, and shortsighted eyes plunged between the pages of one of his precious books.\n",
            " Short, round, young, blonde, good looking and bald--as what St. Louis man past thirty is not? He rejoiced in the agreeable calling of a traveling salesman. Jack's voice would be heard loud in anecdote, introduced in some wise as wise as \"When I was in Houston, Texas, the other day,\" or \"Tell you what it is... those fellers over in Albuquerque are up to a thing or two.\" Jack's standing witticisms were to inquire in a stage whisper of \"Belle or Lou\"\n",
            " Hosmer walked along Lindell Avenue with Fanny in late years. Fanny's eyes were red and swollen and he kissed her in his arms and called her \"my child\" The minister had been impressed with the significance of this marriage which he was called upon to perform. Hosmer had taken Fanny back home in a cab as she requested, because of her eyes that were swollen.\n",
            " Hosmer felt himself capable of stolid endurance since love had proclaimed itself his guide and helper. But now--only to-day--something outside crept into his heart. It was the demon of hate; so new, so awful, so loathsome, he doubted that he could look it in the face and live. Hosmer realized now, that there was no more of that. If he did not wish his life to end in a shipwreck, he must take command and direction of it upon himself.\n",
            " Hosmer's life in the South is not interesting in the country where there are no distractions as you call ladies and work. Hosmer had always considered an amiable woman, with frivolous perceptions; frivolous, but without the vulgarisms. He had always always considered Mrs. Worthington rather amiable, with no vulgarisms; consequently a less objectionable friend for Fanny. Mrs. Dawson uttered a long, low whistle by way of comment.\n",
            " Hosmer and Fanny Dawson were visiting the Dawson's flat at the time of their arrival. Jack Dawson was in negotiations with a person who wanted to rent the house. Hosmer could not say precisely when they would leave the house, but they would go. The windows were thrown wide open, and the lace curtains were pulled aside until no trace remained visible from the street.\n",
            " Lorenzo Worthington's wife had told him of Hosmer's return to St. Louis. Hosmer came over to say good-bye, before leaving for the South, adding \"No, I admit that I've not gone into it. Have you ever thought of this, Mr. Hosmer?\" Hosmer replied: \"Yes, to a certain extent. Always within the forced limits\"\n",
            " Fanny's First Night at Place-du-Bois had not been without attractions for Fanny. She became fatigued and languid; a certain mistrust was creeping into her heart with nearing darkness. Hosmer sat beside her, curiously inattentive to his newspaper. He sat in the Pullman car as it moved out of Union depôt, to see Lou and Jack Dawson smiling and waving good-bye.\n",
            " Hosmer and Fanny arrived at a cottage near St. Louis, with Fanny sobbing on the sofa. Grégoire met them with ease of ease of a courtier, introducing them with a friendly hand shake. The cottage was fully equipped for reception, with Minervy in possession of the kitchen and the formerly reluctant Suze as housemaid.\n",
            " Hosmer and Fanny took tea together before the cheerful fire and he told her something of methods on the plantation, and made her further acquaintance with the various people whom she had thus far encountered. Hosmer went in quest of his sister whom he had not yet seen. Melicent had been told of his marriage some days previously, and had been thrown into such a state of nerves by the intelligence, as to those who surrounded her.\n",
            " Fanny arrived at Place-du-Bois, France, at the end of her first year on the plantation. Fanny was at first shy and diffident, and over watchful of her husband Hosmer. Melicent Grégoire's adoration alone, and her feeble response to it, was all that kept her from Fanny's life.\n",
            " Grégoire was more occupied than he liked during those busy days of harvest and ginning. He resented those half-hearted reasons which removed him from possibility of being with Melicent. When he was with her, his whole being rejoiced in her existence and there was no room for doubt or dread.\n",
            " Thérèse, Fanny Hosmer's mistress, was so wholesome she was not ashamed to show tenderness and sympathy to Fanny. Fanny was unresponsive to Théérése's tenderness, and the first time found her unresponsive. \"I don't say that I always done what was right, Mrs. Hosmer, but I've told you just what suited him about me,\" she said. \"You got to remember there's always two sides to a story.\"\n",
            " Melicent, who did what she wanted with him, had chosen this afternoon, for some inscrutable reason, to make him happy. She had bedecked him with garlands and festoons of autumn leaves, till he looked a very very good-looking Satyr. Fanny, seeing them approach, suddenly chilled and wrapt herself about in her mantle of reserve. \"I guess I better go,\" she said, offering to rise, but Thérèse held out a detaining hand.\n",
            " Thérèse went to see Morico and Fanny arranged the flowers for Fanny, but Fanny sat looking silent and staring into the distance. \"Ole Morico ain't goin' to let you try no monkeyshines on him,\" said Grégoire. \"I guess I better be going,\" said Fanny rising, and this time she no longer detained her. \"Come, Hector--come, old boy,\" she said rising abruptly; and then rowing across the stream.\n",
            " Thérèse's mistress, Marie Louise, was a Creole nurse and attendant from infancy. She had come with her mistress from New Orleans to New Orleans at that lady's marriage with Jérôme Lafirme. But her ever increasing weight had long since removed her from possibility of usefulness, otherwise than supervising her small farm yard.\n",
            " Thérèse pictured the dawn of an unanticipated happiness coming to him: broadening; illuminating; growing progressively in him to answer to her own big-heartedness. Were Fanny, and her own prejudices, worth the sacrifice which she and Fanny had made? This was the doubt that bade fair to unsettle her; that called for a sharp, strong out-putting of the will.\n",
            " Thérèse heard the scraping of Nathan's violin, the noise of shuffling feet and unconstrained laughter from the back veranda. She entered the dining-room, and from its curious scene looked out on a curious scene. Melicent and Grégoire were Melicent on the broad rail of the veranda, patting Juba and singing a loud accompaniment to the breakdown.\n",
            " Morico fussily preceded her into the house and placed a great clumsy home-made rocker at her disposal. He then busied himself in tidying up the room out of deference to his guest. Hosmer succeeded in making himself understood to the old man, and rode away leaving Fanny in his care. He took a key from his pocket and unlocked a side of the manger, drew forth a small flask of whisky. Fanny said to him: \"Your remedy did me more good than I'd've anticipated\"\n",
            " Fanny asked Grégoire why he didn't come to the party: \"Why didn't David come? I thought he said he was coming,\" said Fanny complainingly. \"That's a po' compliment to me, Mrs Hosrma. Can't you stan' my company for that li'le distance?\" Morico went into the house and coming back hastily to the door called Joçint: \"Bring back that flask of whisky that you took off the table\" \"You're a liar: you know I have no use for whisky. That's one of your horrible tricks to make me buy you more,\" said Morico.\n",
            " Hosmer had promised Thérèse that he would take her up to Natchitoches for a dance with Fanny at the end of the night. Hosmer's horse Torpedo was unerringly found at the spring side of the road by the time he rode up to find Théérése waiting for him. He said: \"I can't forgive myself for such a blunder. I never was on him you know--only the little darkies, and they never complained: they'd as well ride cows\"\n",
            " Thérèse Lafirme asked him not to leave Place-du-Bois. She said he should put the mill in some one-another's charge--and go away. He cried: \"But you know you promised to help me--oh I'm talking like an idiot.\" \"Then don't tell me again that I have done right. Only look at me sometimes a little differently,\" he said.\n",
            " Hosmer went out on the veranda feeling much as if he had been wrestling with a strong adversary who had mastered him, and whom he was glad to be freed of, even at the cost of coming inglorious from the conflict. The night was so dark, so hushed, that if ever the dead had wished to take a stroll above ground, they could not have found a more fitting hour.\n",
            " Joçint was following the same path that he traversed daily to and from the mill, and which soon brought him out into the level with its soft-tufted grass and clumps of squat thorn trees. The dog, who had been holding back, dashed to his side, trembling with eagerness, striving to twist his head around to lick the hand that patted him.\n",
            " Thérèse knew at once that the mill was burning, and it was the affair of a moment with her to spring from her bed and don slippers and wrapper. She knocked on Melicent's door to inform her with the startling news; then rang the plantation's bell; next she was at the cottage rousing Hosmer. \"Joçint's work,\" said Grégoire bitingly. \"The damned scoundrel,\" muttered Hosmer, \"where is he?\" \"Don' botha 'bout Joçint; he ain't goin' to set no mo' mill afire,\" he said.\n",
            " Hosmer stood looking on, with folded arms; moved by the grandeur and grandeur of the scene. Hosmer reached him first, and when he gently lifts the dead Joçint, the father this time makes no hinderance, for he too has gone beyond the knowledge of all earthly happenings. The old man totters and falls back to earth, still clinging to the lifeless body of his son.\n",
            " The burning of the mill entailed much work upon Hosmer, to which he turned with a zest. Melicent had shunned Grégoire since the shooting. She had avoided speaking with him -- even looking at him. She went on her task of packing her trunk and filling it more or less systematically from an abundance of woman's toggery.\n",
            " He wanted somebody to talk to him about Melicent's departure. Fanny was pacing slowly up and down theporch to wait for him. He had never seen her look so handsome as now, in a woolen gown that she had not worn before. But she had nothing for him--nothing. All her conversation was addressed to Thérèse.\n",
            " Thérèse went out to Grégoire, who stood waiting on the veranda. Melicent looked at her horrified. \"I don't understand you at all, Mrs.Lafirme. Think what he's done; murdered a defenseless man! How can you have him near you--seated at your table? I don't know what nerves you have in your bodies, you and David.\"\n",
            " A tall, slim negro, young and coal-black, came into the kitchen carrying a meal bag. He was one of the dancers who had displayed their skill before Melicent and Grégoire. Uncle Hiram at once accosted him, asking, \"Well, Pierson, we jest a wonderin' consarnin' you.\" Aunt Belindy: \"I couldn't git a dog gone soul in de town to wait on me\"\n",
            " \"Reckon dat heifa 'Milky' look black side li'le Verdon dat time,\" exclaimed Aunt Belindy. Aunt Betsy asked, \"How you reckon he wint; we wasn't dint; whar he knows wharried we weren't going to Chartrand's Chartrand. \"He went a lopin' twenty yards down, an' heis' uz Unc' Hiurm's shurt an' a trimblin', an' neva say no-way to yansa 'em. He jis' holla-out fu' somebody bring dat hoss tu de steps.\n",
            " \"Lord, Lord, de ways o' de transgressor!\" groaned Uncle Hiram. \"You want to see dem niggas sneaking 'way,\" resumed Pierson, \"dey knows Grégor gwine fo'ce 'em drink; dey knows Chartrand gwine make it a hot fu' \" \"Lordy! I knows you was jis' a trimblinin', Mista Pierson.\"\n",
            " The young colored boy who had lighted Fanny's fire on the first day of her arrival at Place-du-Bois. He it was who lighted her fires on such mornings as they were needed. In mid-January, the grass was fresh and green; trees and plants were putting forth tender shoots, as if in welcome to spring. But finally winter made tardy assertion of its rights.\n",
            " During the afternoon Thérèse knocked at Fanny's door. She wanted to learn how Fanny accepted this unpleasant change of atmosphere. But she saw at a glance that the spirit of disorder had descended upon the Hosmer household. The usually neat room was in a sad state of confusion. Some of the pictures had been taken from the walls, and were leaning here and there against chairs and tables. The mantel ornaments had been removed from the mantel.\n",
            " Hosmer's physical malaise of the morning had augmented as the day went on, and he was beginning to \"admit to himself that he was \"in for it\" After repeated visits to the bedroom, under various pretexts, Fanny grew utterly incapable of doing more than sit and gaze stupidly at Thérèse. She continued to talk disjointedly of Belle Worthington and her well-known tyrannical characteristics in regard to cleanliness; finishing by weeping mildly at the prospect of her own inability to ever reach the high standard required by her exacting friend. Hosmer left his office; a rough temporary shanty, put together near the ruined mill, put\n",
            " Fanny awoke close upon morning, not knowing what had aroused her. Hosmer was tossing about and his outstretched arm lay across her face. She took his hand to move it away, and it burned her like a coal of fire. As she touched him he began to talk incoherently. He evidently fancied himself dictating a letter to some insurance company.\n",
            " Lucilla went out to get a breath of fresh air as her mother had requested, but she did not go far to seek it. Lucilla asked Aunt Belindy: \"W'at in God A'Mighty's name you call dat 'ar?\" The little girl replied: \"Yo' ax? I don't want to do something that you don't mean that you do--I mean you want to eat something and don't eat it.\"\n",
            " Lucilla: \"You mustn't say such things to me; I'm going to be a religious\" Aunt Belindy: \"The religious never get married,\" turning very red, \"and don't live in the world like others\" Aunt: \"Most people have to spend years and years in purgatory, before they can get to Heaven\" Lucilla gained \"twenty-five years' indulgence\"\n",
            " Mrs. Worthington was a delicate refined little woman, somewhat old-fashioned and struggling to keep pace with the modern conduct of life. Thérèse had given what information lay within her range, concerning the company which was expected. But her confidences had plainly been insufficient to prepare Mrs. Duplan for the startling effect produced by Mrs.-Worthington on that little miss.\n",
            " Thérèse was conscious of a change in Fanny's attitude, and felt herself unable to account for it, which she knew played a not unimportant rôle with the manner of a large majority of women. Mr. Worthington's claim to entire indifference, if not inability--confirmed by his wife-- was accepted as the most sincere, and that gentleman was excluded.\n",
            " Lucilla asked Ninette whether she was going to the convent, which she said was the best place in the world. \"I've been saving up money for the longest time, oh ever so long, and I've got eighteen dollars and sixty cents, and if I don't like it, I'm going to run away,\" she said. Lucilla crossed her heart carefully, though a little reluctantly.\n",
            " The party broke up at a late hour, though the Duplans had a long distance to go, and, moreover, had to cross the high and turbid river to reach their carriage. Fanny looked moodily at them both, jealously wondering at the cause of their good humor. Mr. Duplan took occasion of a moment aside to whisper to Hosmer with the air of a connoisseur, \"fine woman that Mrs. Worthington of yours\"\n",
            " Rufe Jimson spoke to Thérèse as he might have spoken to one of her black servants, or as he would have addressed a princess of royal blood. \"I reckon thar hain't no ford hereabouts?\" he asked, looking at her with a certain challenge. \"There's no road on this side,\" she said, turning away to fasten more securely the escaped branches of a rose-bush.\n",
            " Thérèse knew Grégoire was dead by the hand of a stranger. She understood it all now. The manner of his death was plain to her as if she had seen it. The taking of a man's life counted as little as it had once counted with his victim.\n",
            " Thérèse devoted a morning to the writing of letters, acquainting various members of the family with the unhappy intelligence of her grief. She wrote first to Madame Santien, living now her lazy life in Paris, with eyes closed to the duties that lay before her and her heart choked up with an egoism that withered even the mother-of-the-people's instincts. The last letter was sent to Melicent, with a dry, unemotional telling, that sounded heartless when she read it over.\n",
            " Melicent was at a progressive euchre party at the time. She was disgusted with the disgusting action of Mrs. Van Wycke. She called her maid, Johannah, to say goodbye to Mrs. Manning. The letter was written neatly and addressed, but Melicent grew steadily from her nerveless clasp.\n",
            " When she read it three times she folded it slowly and carefully and locked it away in her desk. \"Put that gown away; I shan't need it,\" she said. \"Oh, Miss, it's not Mr. David! nor yet one of those sweet relations in Utica? leastways not I hope that beautiful Miss Gertrude, with such a beautiful hair as I never see for the goldness of it and not dyed, is that her mother actually cried when it was cut off?\" \"No, Johannah; only a very dear friend.\"\n",
            " Hosmer was seated at table at table, having finished his breakfast. He looked at his wife sitting opposite him, but turned rather hastily to gaze with a certain entreaty into the big kind eyes of the great shaggy dog who stood at his side. \"I knew there was something wrong,\" he said abruptly, with his eyes still fixed on the dog, and his fingers thrust into the animal's matted wool, \"Where's the mail this morning?\" \"I don't know if that stupid boy's gone for it or not. I told him. You can't depend on any one in a place like this.\"\n",
            " Hosmer passed the day with a great pain at his heart. He felt much much of the hauntingly cruelly of his wife Fanny as a man who inflicted an irreparable hurt upon some small, weak, irresponsible, irresponsible creature. The only reparation that lay within Hosmer lay within his true power was an open and manly apology.\n",
            " Hosmer came home early in the afternoon and his wife was not there. The house was deserted; even the servants had disappeared. Fanny was not now the wife whom he hated; his own act of the morning had changed her into the human being, the weak creature whom he had wronged. He left the house hastily, hardly reassured by Betsy's information.\n",
            " Hosmer found Fanny sitting before the fire holding a pair of very wet smoking feet to dry. The big good-natured negress had seen his approach from the window. Hosmer saw too at a glance that her dominant passion had been leading and now controlled her. \"You must be crazy,\" she replied, with a slow glance upward.\n",
            " Fanny was in Marie Louise's big rocker, balancing comfortably back and forth with a swing that had become automatic. Hosmer had no intention of returning home without his wife. He only wanted to be out under the sky; he wanted to breathe, to use his muscles again. He would go and help cross the flat if need be; anxietyoccupation that promised him relief in physical effort.\n",
            " Hosmer and the teamster were in the fore-end of the boat; Nathan in the rear, and Aunt Agnes standing in the center between the wagon and railing. The ill-mated horses stood motionless, letting fall their dejected heads with apathetic droop. They were speeding rapidly towards the scene of catastrophe; but to Hosmer they crawled. \"Hold fast--for God's sake--hold fast!\" he shouted to Fanny, who was swaying with swaying figure to door post.\n",
            " The air of an early March day in New Orleans was filled with the spring and all its promises. It was folly to shut it out from nook or cranny. Worse than folly the lady thought who was making futile efforts to open the car window near which she sat. Her face had grown pink with the effort. A husband, but doubly a father, surrounded and sat upon by a small band of offspring. A gold chain that hung around her neck. The presence of a large valise, an overcoat, a cane and an umbrella, bespoke a further occupant.\n",
            " Thérèse had sailed from New Orleans for Paris six months ago. Hosmer had gone away at once with the dead body of his wife; when the two had clasped hands without words that dared be uttered. But that was a year ago, might not such length of time be hoped to rub the edge off a pain that was not by its nature lasting?\n",
            " Hosmer and Thérèse married one month after meeting on the train. The sight of the scar on his forehead was like a painful letter when his eyes looked into her own. Hosmer: \"I couldn't have borne it but for you--the thought of you always present with me; helping me to take myself out of the past\"\n",
            " Hosmer Griesmann's sister wrote him a letter urging him to take a trip to Yosemite with her. The letter said: 'I know you won't object to the trip, David, I have my heart so set on it. The expense will be trifling, seeing there are four of the carriage hire, restaurant and all that: and it counts'\n",
            " David Hosmer writes to his wife, Thérèse, asking her to read the letter. He asks: \"Who do you suppose seized on to me in Vandervoort's the other day, but that impertinent Mrs. Belle Worthington! Positively took me by the coat and commenced to gush about dear sister Thérése. She said: \"That Mrs. Lafirme's a trump. Hope you won't take offense, but I must say, your brother David's a perfect stick--it's what I always said.\" Hosmer: \"Can you conceive of such shocking impertinence?'\n",
            " \"Oh, surely not, David,\" she said, drawing back. \"Then let me tell you something,\" he drew her head down and whispered something in her pink ear that he just brushed with his lips. It made Thérèse laugh and turn very rosy in the moonlight.\n"
